# Let me play Iris!

This mod removes the Iris warning message when playing with Not Enough Crashes (that is now here EVERY launch)
It does it by forcing the "hasNEC" value to false after Iris sets it to true


Will soon change it so that it still display a message in chat telling the player that NEC and Iris have compatibility issues, I'll also change the name to "Calm Down Iris" when it is done
